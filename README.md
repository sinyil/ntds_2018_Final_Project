****Exposing the True Terrorist Network*****

******************About Data Set****************

In this project we work with the Terrorist Relations dataset that 
is taken from the Profile in Terror (PIT)  knowledge base as presented in docs. 
This dataset illustrates an affiliation network of terrorists where nodes are
represented as relations and edges as terrorists.As such, a node consists of two
terrorist identifiers and two nodes are connected by an edge if they share a common
terrorist. This representation is known as a Line Graph and is often used in 
classification tasks where the interest is placed on the label of two interlinked 
network entities rather than the labels of the entities themselves.

************************************************
******************Aim of Project****************

As terrorists arguably present the largest threat to today's society, it is of great
interest to analyse and reveal interesting properties of their network in order to guide
anti-terrorist campaigns and help ensure public safety around the world.This dataset was
of particular interest as data relating to terrorists is scarce due to the secretive 
nature of terrorist activities. The original PIT dataset contains relevant terrorism
related information extracted from public news sources such as newspapers, broadcasts,
and court proceedings. Hence, this dataset is purely built on empirical evidences and
it safe to assume that it is incomplete.

As a result, we set ourselves the objective of revealing the complete terrorist network
and subsequently performing a network analysis on both the original and expanded networks.
 Finally, we aim to define the top priority terrorist(s) for anti-terrorism campaigns to 
target in order to successfully disrupt and weaken the network.
